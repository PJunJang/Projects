# My Group Project Contributions

This repository contains a collection of links to the group projects where I made significant contributions. These contributions include:

## DeFazio's Pizzeria, Troy, NY - Mobile Order/Catering Application
- Project Overview: The team project aimed to develop a mobile application for DeFazio's Pizzeria in Troy, NY that allowed customers to make reservations and place catering orders through the app. It included features such as viewing the menu, estimating waiting time for an order, and logging in as an administrator to manage orders.
- My Contribution: I served as a front-end developer for the creation of the mobile application, using React Native. I provided customers with the ability to order food, make reservations, and receive real-time updates on wait times. I also improved the user experience by incorporating various components and features, such as a scroll-view and buttons for page redirections. I organized each page and component by adding a dedicated Stylesheet to enhance component reusability and maintain a clean code structure.

## Plan&Pantry - MEAN Stack Development Team Project
- Project Overview: Plan & Pantry is a web app designed to simplify recipe management. It allows users to keep track of their favorite recipes, edit and add new ones, share with others, and even print them out. With the ability to set the desired number of servings, Plan & Pantry does the math for you, and you can search for recipes by tags or categories.
- My Contribution: As a full-stack developer, I contributed to the group project "Plan & Pantry," which allows users to store and manage their ingredients, recipes, and search for desired or trending recipes on the platform. I implemented Angular framework with CSS/Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface that works seamlessly across both mobile and desktop devices. I integrated Firebase for backend management, handling authentication, server, and database management. Using Node.js, I designed a flexible and scalable REST API, allowing seamless integration with other RESTful web services. I also conducted thorough testing and simulation to ensure a bug-free and secure product release. Additionally, I optimized the code quality through code reviews and the use of CodeQL to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities.

## VACA.com - Web Application for Budgeting Travelers
- Project Overview: Vaca.com is a web application that helps users plan their vacations by providing information about tourist locations within their budget. Users can input their budget, starting location, and travel dates, and the app will display a list of options that fit their requirements, including information about nearby hotels, transportation, and attractions. The app enables users to find the best vacation spots that fit their budget and preferences.
- My Contribution: As a front-end developer for VACA.com, I created a visually appealing and responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I also designed and implemented the logo for the application using Adobe Illustrator and InDesign. In collaboration with the back-end developers, I integrated the UI with the application's logic and data to ensure seamless functionality and optimal performance. Thorough testing and debugging were conducted to ensure reliability, security, and performance across various devices and platforms.

## Johnson and Johnson - Massively Scaling Documents to Data-Centric Sets
- Project Overview: A team of four students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) worked with Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to develop a centralized document storage solution for the Q&C department. The goal was to make it easier for J&J to manage and track more than one million documents related to regulations and standard operating procedures imposed by different countries, departments, and agencies. The solution needed to be scalable and allow for easy retrieval of information. The project was completed successfully, providing a solution to J&J's document management challenges.
- My Contribution: I developed a data transformation routine using Python libraries like Pandas, Streamlit, and xml.etree.elementtree to convert Johnson & Johnson's XML documents into structured CSV tables, improving the accuracy and consistency of the data. I utilized modern software development methodologies like Agile, Git, and Jira to ensure effective collaboration, version control, and project management. I optimized data processing by parsing and organizing the data into hierarchical tables, making NLP machine-learning models more accurate and consistent. Lastly, I conducted a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of the proposed solution, providing valuable insights and recommendations to stakeholders.
